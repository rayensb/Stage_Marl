# Phase 2 checkpoint — active reference point, 2026-08-20

**If you are a different session or agent working in this shared
worktree: this is live, in-progress, partially-validated work.** Do not
modify `envs/formation_env.py`, `config.py`, `training/*.py`, merge or
rebase `phase2-combined`/`xyz-spread-fixed`, or launch/cancel Kaggle runs
under the `stage-marl-phase2-*` or `stage-marl-spread-fixed-*` names
without checking with the user first. Silent changes here can invalidate
in-flight Kaggle runs or make it impossible to tell which results map to
which code state. The deployment work in `deployment/` is a separate,
independent track (see `deployment/docs/PHASE2_HANDOFF.md`) and is fine to
keep working on -- this note is about the training/env code specifically.

## What this reference point is

Four combined fixes for the N=4 collision problem, validated:

1. Multi-pass brake convergence (POCS-style repeated projection).
2. Thresholded brake-engagement reward penalty.
3. N-aware safety margin (`EDGE_TARGET` scales with simultaneous-neighbor
   count).
4. XYZ (true 3D) formation spread -- **note**: the 5-seed validation run
   below used the *pre-fix* angle (109.47/120 deg, wrong). The angle was
   corrected to 60 deg (commit `ac98d67`) after that run had already
   launched. `xyz-spread-fixed` (branch, isolated from the other three
   fixes) is re-testing the corrected version now -- see "Currently
   running" below.

**Validated**: 5-seed Kaggle run, 5M steps, `phase2-combined` branch --
3x N=4 (all clean: 0% collision, best seed's `tracking_rmse` 1.43, the
best of the project), 1x N=3 (clean collision, some `target_lost` noise in
one seed -- second seed running now to check), 1x N=2 (clean). Best
checkpoints saved in `models/` as `actor_best_{1,2,3}_20260820-1255_
3f9069c-n4-5m-phase2-seed{1,2,3}.pt`, `actor_best_n3_1_...`,
`actor_best_n2_1_...`.

**New finding (2026-08-20, `training/diagnose_horizon.py`)**: training
episodes are 10 simulated seconds (`MAX_STEPS=200`, by design -- see
`DECISIONS.md`, this is correct for how PPO learns and should not be
changed casually). Running the best N=4 checkpoint for 60 simulated
seconds instead (frozen policy, no retraining, doesn't terminate on the
first failure so degradation past the training horizon is actually
visible) shows tracking error climbing from 0.95 (0-10s, matches
training) to a peak of 3.66 (20-30s) before recovering to 1.5-1.8
(40-60s). No collision or target_lost the whole time -- the abstract sim
has no ground/physics failure mode, so it can't show a crash -- but that
20-30s worst window sits *directly inside* the 15-40s window the real
PX4/Gazebo deployment actually crashed in (see
`deployment/docs/PHASE2_HANDOFF.md`). This is real, load-bearing evidence
for a training-horizon-vs-real-flight-duration mismatch as (at least part
of) the deployment crash's cause, not just a plausible story. Worth
reading by whoever picks up the deployment crash investigation next.

**Currently running on Kaggle** (started 2026-08-20, ~1.5M steps each,
smaller/faster than the validation run above):
- `stage-marl-spread-fixed-seed1` (branch `xyz-spread-fixed`, N=4) --
  isolated test of the corrected 60 deg spread angle, to see whether the
  pre-fix bug actually cost anything.
- `stage-marl-phase2-n3-seed2` (branch `phase2-combined`, N=3) -- second
  seed, checking whether seed1's `target_lost` noise was real or
  seed-variance.

**Not yet done**: `phase2-combined` needs a manual
`git push origin phase2-combined:main` (blocked by the permission
classifier on a direct push from the agent, verified as a clean
fast-forward, no conflicts) -- `main` is still behind everything from
tonight until that's run.

**Brake instrumentation** (commit `ad4c483`): `_apply_brake` now exposes
`brake_passes`/`brake_violation`/`k_active` diagnostics (see its
docstring), threaded to 4 new `training_log_*.csv` columns
(`mean_brake_passes`, `max_brake_violation`, `mean_brake_solo`,
`mean_brake_multi`). Pure logging addition, doesn't change training
behavior -- safe to build on without re-validating.

## Open, not yet decided

- Whether to extend `MAX_STEPS`/train at a longer horizon given the
  finding above -- a real training-behavior change, needs its own
  validation, not something to bundle into what's running now.
- "Genetic/evolutionary" training as an alternative to PPO -- raised,
  not adopted; PPO is what's producing the results above.
- GPU was already measured slower than CPU for this network size
  (`DECISIONS.md`) -- not revisit unless the network architecture changes
  enough to change that math (e.g. the permutation-invariant encoder idea
  queued elsewhere).
